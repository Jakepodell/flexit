Deck Changes

1. Change font to sans serif
2. Slide 3 is too wordy, should be made cleaner
	only include the question, have the answer and other words prepared
		have the question and answer be after the "problems for gyms area"
	move the part about digital aggregators to a different slide
5-6. The whole problems section can probably be reduced down
8-11. The solutions section can also probably be 2 slides max
11. too busy, keep to only a few icons


keep a gradient header for all slides



more creative, soften and lighten everything up and make more fluid

not sure I love the fonts

screenshots should be sleek
