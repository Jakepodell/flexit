Deck Changes

1. Change font to sans serif
2. Slide 3 is too wordy, should be made cleaner
	only include the question, have the answer and other words prepared
		have the question and answer be after the "problems for gyms area"
	move the part about digital aggregators to a different slide
5-6. The whole problems section can probably be reduced down
8-11. The solutions section can also probably be 2 slides max
11. too busy, keep to only a few icons


keep a gradient header for all slides



more creative, soften and lighten everything up and make more fluid

not sure I love the fonts

screenshots should be sleek

both quotes from slide 2

get more creative, less powerpointy

slide 10




second thing he wants:

he wants to work through everything on the deck
1 pager w/ content from stuff on the deck

	crumbs: 3 circles, section in the deck
	opportunity- whats the problem

4/9

break into batches of 200

bottom color is black

create a couple drafts of different layout options consistent across all slides

second tab, year by year, want tab 1

for the table, find some kind of middle ground between how it is and what il be dong with 16

quick one pages, build same way as another document he will send me




thoughts on length

one pager: 

admin panel checking someone out and the timer





4/13


barbell thats not that obtrusive for now

content heavy needs white or other colors

now I have the branding

play around with split screens and see what looks best

heavy on content on one side

likes on black better, but some slides look better with white


content in the deck is slowly improiving, like the general story

busy 4-6 then avail after


app screens and customer
